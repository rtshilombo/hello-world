# Digital Bridge
Bigital Bridge/Mbuji-Mayi

My name is Richard Tshilombo and I am the founder of Digital Bridge, a start-up located in Mbuji-Mayi, which aims at teaching robotics.

I am currently working as a Manufacturing engineer in the automotive industry in the USA, and I have a passion for automated systems, robotics, and teaching.

This series of lessons is an introduction to Arduino for people with no previous coding knowledge.  Beyond coding the students will be introduced on how to build a robot using sensors and actuators.
